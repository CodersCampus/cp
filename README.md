# SpringWise 

## Basic Idea 

- We are creating this app to showcase our skills and learn new skills along the way.

- The app will consist of a main database table/ hibernate entity/ java object, the "Spring Project".

- The Spring Project will have an id, a name, a description, a set of contributors, etc.There will be a main page where you can see all of the projects and click each one to be sent to its view.

- Each project will be contained in this parent project. 

## What **you** will be doing
You will be responsible for:

- Creating new issues, tickets, features to be added, bugs to be fixed, etc.
- Creating branches for the above
- Creating pull requests for your branches to be reviewed
- Reviewing other's contributions
- Documenting your changes (to be discussed)

## When we will be working on this

- We will be doing live coding in the check-ins when there are no other pressing topics.

- You can work on your own branches and issues whenever you would like/ have time.
