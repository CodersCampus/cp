# Work Flow Sequence

- Each player takes a turn while screen sharing and taking help from other players
- Each "play" starts with an issue and ends with that player's pull request being merged and pulled down by other players.
- Scoring takes place as a part of the pull request.

## Standard Operating Procedure(SOP) - Issues

- Make sure you are on the most current version of default branch (usually dev)

### Issue Workflow Steps

- Assignment of ticket
- Create and navigate to new branch 
- create failing unit test
- write code that satisfies unit test
- push branch
- pull request
- code review
- merge to dev

- (SIMPLE GIT WORKFLOW)
- Create a new branch for the task. This will allow you to work on the task without affecting the main branch of the project.
- Make your changes to the code. Once you have made your changes, you should commit them to the branch.
- Push your changes to the remote repository. This will allow other developers to see your changes and collaborate on the task.
- Test your changes. Once you have pushed your changes, you should test them to make sure they work as expected.
- Merge your changes into the main branch. Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can merge them into the main branch of the project.
- Delete the branch. Once your changes have been merged into the main branch, you can delete the branch.
- This is just a sample workflow, and you may need to adjust it to fit the specific needs of your project. However, it should give you a good starting point for managing your code changes.

- (ADDITIONAL TIPS)
- Use descriptive commit messages. When you commit your changes, be sure to use descriptive commit messages that explain what you changed and why. This will make it easier for other developers to understand your changes and collaborate on the project.
- Use branches for different features. If you are working on a large project, it is a good idea to use branches for different features. This will allow you to work on different features independently and merge them together later.
- Use pull requests to merge changes. When you are ready to merge your changes into the main branch, you should use a pull request. This will allow other developers to review your changes and provide feedback before they are merged.
- Use a continuous integration (CI) server. A CI server can automate the testing and deployment of your code. This can help you to ensure that your code is always working and that it is deployed to production in a timely manner.



## Code Review

- before committing, aggregate you latest score
- other?
