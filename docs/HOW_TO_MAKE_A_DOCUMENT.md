# How to make a document

This is going to show you how to successfully make a markdown document.

- Start in the `docs` folder.
- Make a file using `upper case snake case`
- Start title with `# something`
- Make sections for each thing // reference ## 
- Use this link for external markdown // fill in later

## Start in the docs folder
blah
## You can also put HTML in here where ever you'd like

<h1>Title</h1>
<p>This is a dope paragraph</p>

If we need more we will add to it later.
