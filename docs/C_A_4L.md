# ca and the 4 Ls

Notes:
- rename springwise to ca and make it `enrollment to retirement`
- take it to both foundations and alumni
- make it a lifelong value enhancement app as measured by results

## What are the 4Ls

4Ls
- **[log]** - data as a strategy. It's what we do.
- **[love]** - We watch out for each other.
- **[lift]** - the pleasure of measurable results.
- **[leave]** - automate and inform when sufficient -> `leave` it behind as a `lift`.

## [log]

It's what we do. Data as a strategy, not just data as a career.

#### Data as a Strategy

We know that we have what it takes as potential employees, but maintaining a convincing set of evidence does seem to be the trickiest part.

So we use our data collecting skills to collect data on our behalf.

## [love] 

We watch out for each other. It's the least we could do. 

Enough said.

## [lift]

We increase our value to the marketplace through the pleasure of measurable results.

Everything we do in the curriculumn is about that one thing - acheiving measureable results:

- Exercises
- Assignments
- Live Coding
- Sprint Releases

## [leave]

We don't just improve our skills, we leave something behind for the next time, or the next coder.

... even if the next coder is just our own self on a different day. 

- Docs
- Tools
- Processes

## Enrollment to Retirement?

Once `ca`, or the `coder packaging` app is live, and we are doing checkins as well as enhancing the value of our alumni, it would seem logical to:

1. Extend the checkins all the way forward into the first foundations meeting.
1. Extend the app's usage all the way through the alumni's career.

By extending the 4Ls through the entire time period, it would seem more logical.

## Renaming springwise to `ca`

Just easier to say. `ca` where is pronounced "C A"

Also same as `coder packaging` so it's not dual name thing that you constantly have to explain.

Doesn't hurt that it aligns with `Coders Campus` at least to some degree.
